## Reflection on CV Creation

This module on CV creation has transformed my understanding of how to craft a compelling, professional resume that captures an employer’s attention. I have learned that a CV is not merely a summary of my work history, but a strategic marketing tool designed to showcase my unique value. Since employers often spend only a few seconds reviewing a CV, every detail — from layout to word choice — must be deliberate. For example, placing the most important qualifications first and using strong action verbs brings achievements to life, in contrast to my previous method of merely listing duties.

Another key lesson was the importance of **customizing my CV for each job application**. Instead of relying on a generic template, I now align the skills and experiences highlighted in the job description with my own relevant accomplishments. For instance, if applying for a project management role, I prioritize leadership experiences and include measurable outcomes to demonstrate impact. The module also clarified how to balance brevity with detail, keeping the CV concise (1–2 pages) while still showcasing meaningful results.

Finally, the module highlighted the complementary role of a **cover letter**. While the CV provides factual evidence of my qualifications, the cover letter adds narrative context, explaining my motivation and suitability for the role. Using both together allows me to market myself effectively as not only qualified but also culturally aligned with prospective employers.
