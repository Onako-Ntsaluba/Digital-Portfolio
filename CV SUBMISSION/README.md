## Reflection on Writing and Submitting My CV

Writing and submitting my CV was a reflective process that highlighted the importance of communication strategy and deliberate self-presentation. I realized that a CV is not just a resume but a targeted marketing document that must align both with my professional profile and the expectations of potential employers. I learned how to strategically select and emphasize my most valuable skills and experiences for IT positions, such as my Java programming assignments and database administration coursework, while avoiding generic statements that add little value.

The exercise also revealed gaps in my work experience, prompting me to include internships and freelance projects to strengthen this section. I discovered that structure and concision are critical; applying consistent formatting, bullet points, and concise text made my CV easier to read and more impactful. Moving forward, I plan to update my CV regularly by adding new qualifications and seeking feedback to ensure it continues to effectively reflect my professional growth.

Ultimately, this exercise reinforced that a CV is a dynamic document â€” a living record of my career journey. It is not merely a reflection of where I have been, but a strategic tool to align my experiences and achievements with the opportunities I want to pursue in the future.
