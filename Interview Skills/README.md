## Reflection on Interview Skills (Using the STAR Technique)

During the Interview Skills module, I was involved in mock interviews and various exercises that were designed to prepare students for real job interviews. Initially, when the module started, I was nervous and did not know how to give good responses to interview questions, especially those that required personal reflection or examples of issues that were resolved. My greatest challenge was expressing my strengths confidently and communicating professionally during an interview. I knew that I needed to improve on processes that would enable me to function well under pressure and be perceived as professional and authentic.

To address these challenges, I spent time learning common interview questions and practiced responding in the framework of the STAR method â€” Situation, Task, Action, and Result. I also had peer review sessions in which I received great tips on improving my posture, making eye contact, and projecting my voice. In class sessions, I opted to tape my mock interviews and view them later to look for areas of improvement. I took time to work on my non-verbal communication, ensuring that body language sent out confidence and professionalism, and practiced short, clear responses relevant to the job role being simulated.

By the end of the module, I had significantly enhanced my interview performance. I felt more confident in communicating my experience, laying out my strengths, and describing how these aligned with likely requirements in a job. My teacher and peers complimented my progress, especially my ability to remain calm under stressful conditions and communicate effectively. I discovered that preparation and self-awareness are the keys to successful interviews. I gained knowledge that every interview is an opportunity to display not only my qualifications, but also my personality and adaptability. The STAR approach has been an invaluable tool that I will continue to employ in future interviews and work-related opportunities to accurately and sincerely communicate my achievements.
