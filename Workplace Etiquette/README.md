## Reflection on Workplace Etiquette (Using the STAR Technique)

Through the Workplace Etiquette module, I had to practice and learn professional behavior in a simulated workplace environment. At first, I found it challenging to exercise correct workplace etiquette all the time, such as being punctual, dressing professionally, communicating respectfully, and using technology correctly. My aim was to master skills for conveying professionalism and making a good impression in the workplace.

To reinforce, I actively participated in role-plays, observed professional conduct via case studies, and was guided by my lecturer and peers. I persisted in courteous and respectful communication, adhered to meeting protocols, and maintained a professional approach both in person and online. I also employed strategies to operate effectively with time, prioritize actions, and address fellow workers respectfully in group work. Such practices assisted me in internalizing professional norms and applying them in real-life situations.

By the end of the module, I had seen significant improvement in my workplace behavior and confidence. I was able to demonstrate professionalism at all times, communicate respectfully to managers and colleagues, and maintain reliability in task completion. This experience reinforced the importance of workplace etiquette as a major component of career success. I understood that professional behavior not only portrays one's integrity but also forges good relationships, teamwork, and credibility in any organization.
