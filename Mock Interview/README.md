## Mock Interview Reflection (Using the STAR Technique) 

While going through the Mock Interview practice, I was given the opportunity to conduct a realistic job interview experience as part of my Work Readiness Training. The exercise was designed to help students rehearse presentation and communication skills in a professional setting. Initially, I was slightly nervous and did not understand how to reply confidently during questions with a smooth conversation flow. My greatest struggle was coping with interview nervousness and structuring my responses in a manner where my strengths would be convincingly highlighted.

To cope with these challenges, I prepared thoroughly by learning about the organization and role for which my mock interview was carried out. I practiced answering common interview questions using the STAR technique — stating the Situation, Task, Action, and Result of every situation in my school and work experience. I also practiced improving my body language by making good eye contact, standing straight, and positive body language. After the interview, I evaluated the feedback provided by the interviewer, where I noted my areas of strength, which included expanding upon my answers as well as reducing the usage of filler words. Through this exercise, I managed to tone my speech and gain more self-confidence. 

After the exercise, I noticed a huge improvement in my capability to express myself clearly and professionally. I felt more equipped to respond to questions in a better way, relate my experience to job-related skills, and sell myself more confidently. I was given good feedback on my poise and structured responses. Through this mock interviewing exercise, I gained the insight that preparation, self-awareness, and reflection are the key determinants of interview success. I have realized that each interview—real or mock—is an opportunity to learn, build, and enhance my personal brand as a young professional.
