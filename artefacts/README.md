# ðŸªž Business Communication Reflection (Using the STAR Technique)

During my Business Communication course, I had to accomplish various professional writing and presentation assignments such as report writing, becoming an expert in email etiquette, and delivering a group presentation. Initially, it was challenging for me to express myself formally and structure my documents according to business standards. My communication style was too casual, and I sometimes struggled to arrange my ideas in a coherent manner for the professional reader. The key objective was to acquire and improve effective workplace communication skillsâ€”written and verbalâ€”and to demonstrate an understanding of communicating professionally in different business settings.

To improve, I participated in class discussions vigorously, asked for constructive feedback from my lecturer, and learned examples of professional business letters. I practiced the 7 Cs of communication â€” clear, concise, concrete, correct, coherent, complete, and courteous â€” in order to improve my writing and presentation skills. In group activities, I started by coordinating our communication plan, keeping everyone well-coordinated and informed. I employed active listening skills during meetings to gain clearer understanding and fewer misunderstandings.

At the end of the module, my professional competence and self-assurance in communication had grown significantly. I was able to produce well-structured, persuasive reports, deliver good presentations, and convey messages with respect and effectiveness to colleagues. I learned through this experience that the true strength of communication lies not in speaking or writingâ€”it is building a culture of comprehension, professionalism, and projecting oneself with integrity. I now approach every message or presentation with precision and compassion, always looking for ways to inform, connect, and inspire my audience. The STAR framework has improved my ability to reflect reflectively and continues to guide my commitment to continuous self-expansion in professional communication.
