## Reflection on Business Communication (Using the STAR Technique)

During my Business Communication module, I was required to complete various professional writing and presentation tasks such as report writing, mastering email etiquette, and delivering a group presentation. Initially, I found it challenging to express my ideas formally and structure my documents according to business standards. My communication style was often too casual, and I sometimes struggled to organize my thoughts clearly for a professional audience. The main objective was to develop effective workplace communication skills—both written and verbal—and to demonstrate an understanding of how to communicate professionally in different business contexts.

To improve, I actively participated in class discussions, sought constructive feedback from my lecturer, and reviewed examples of professional business correspondence. I practiced using the 7 Cs of communication — clear, concise, concrete, correct, coherent, complete, and courteous — to refine my writing and presentation style. During group work, I took initiative by organizing our communication strategy, ensuring that all members remained informed and aligned. I also applied active listening techniques during meetings to promote understanding and reduce miscommunication.

By the end of the module, my confidence and professionalism in communication had grown significantly. I was able to produce well-structured, persuasive reports, deliver engaging presentations, and communicate respectfully and effectively with peers. This experience helped me realize that effective communication extends beyond speaking or writing—it is about fostering understanding, building professional relationships, and presenting oneself with credibility. I now approach every message or presentation with clarity and empathy, always aiming to inform, engage, and connect with my audience. The STAR framework has deepened my ability to reflect meaningfully and continues to guide my commitment to continuous self-improvement in professional communication.
